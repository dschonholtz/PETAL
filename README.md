# PETAL
## Person Eye Tracking Application Launcher


### Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to make a simple headset that can be combo'd with a windows application anyone can 
install on their windows computer.

### Issues

If you are about to work on something related to this any help is appreciated but it would be most helpful for
you to work off of one of the issues logged on github. You can find the repo here: 
[PETAL REPO](https://github.com/dschonholtz/PETAL)

To best help us track issues and to make sure people don't work on multiple issues at once if you pull a new
issue off of the backlog (TODO) move the associated ticket from the todo column to the in progress column and 
assign yourself to the ticket.

### Using git properly

Using git properly to make sure that no work is lost and everyone can work on the same project is essential 
when working as a team.

With this in mind, here are a few recomendations:

install [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) and use it as your merge and diff tools I'm working on setting this up myself
and will post a tutorial soon.

When you start working on a new feature or ticket you should make a new branch off of master.
Then when you are ready to make a pull request to merge you changes into master you should do a rebase or a merge.
Then issue the PR.

This will be updated to be clarified shortly.
